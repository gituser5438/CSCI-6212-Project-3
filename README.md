# CSCI-6212-Project-3

boxes.java contains the solution to this problem

Box Stacking.  You are given a set of n types of rectangular 3-D boxes, where the i^th box has height h(i), width w(i) and depth d(i) (all real numbers). You want to create a stack of boxes which is as tall as possible, but you can only stack a box on top of another box if the dimensions of the 2-D base of the lower box are each strictly larger than those of the 2-D base of the higher box. Of course, you can rotate a box so that any side functions as its base. It is also allowable to use multiple instances of the same type of box.


All of the code is in boxes.java.  To run it you need to compile and then run

javac boxes.java
java boxes

There are two examples and then a time experiment which runs in a few seconds.  The main method at the beginning (line 7) can be edited to run additional examples or set different values for n in the run experiment.
